# From Statistics to Machine Learning
[![en](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-en-red.svg)](README.md)

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook**–based lab designed to
guide students on a smooth, intuitive path from basic statistical
methods to modern machine learning.

This material is designed for **undergraduate students in the physical
sciences**, especially those who are comfortable with mathematics and
programming but are new to machine learning.
The goal is to provide a coherent bridge between the statistical tools
they already know and the ML methods they want to learn.
